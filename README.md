# math-notes

Some of my math notes written in LaTeX as part of my studies in Mathematics during my Computer Science bachelor's degree.

This repository exists with a single purpose: to store my notes in LaTeX format.

Most of the content is written in my native language (Portuguese). If you can understand it, feel free to explore.

This is not meant to showcase advanced mathematics or deep theoretical mastery, just a personal archive of my learning process.
